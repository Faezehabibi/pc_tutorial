## What we knew before predictive coding?

### Retina
Last stage in retina, Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs), spatially reduces redundancy in sensory input while Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) reduces redundant information in the time domain.
Retina spot process the sensory input in a small pathches processed in local in lowest level. Connecting these local patched areas the lines line dot
And with the lines you can make a scene
Your retina has lots of units responsible for processing small patches of the visual data
I it starts by dots

### Orientation Selective Responde
Simple cells in Hubble and Wiesel Experiment 1962

### End-stopped
Extra-classical receptive fields (Contextual Modulation and Surround Suppression) effects clue that the brain is using efficient coding (redundancy reduction).
To investigate whether some of these effects could 
result from the extended positive correlations along 
dominant orientation directions in natural images, 

### Sparcse Coding (1996)

## Predictive Coding (1999)


**P.S.** As someone with background in computer science and computational math I personally found reading old papers as this one challenging when lack of required backgrounds. On the other hand growing with newer concepts in science and tech, some of the stuffs might look very obvious at first which brings confusing, and determining what has been established before and the predictive coding and what makes it so interesting seems unclear at first; at least to me. Here I decided to teach the predictive coding to me, who couldn't find the glory at first but got fascinated when they delve deeper. 

Here, I attempted to reflect my first principal in learning. I build understanding by fundamentals, only then I am allowed to acquire knowledge by reading recent advancements which is deepening the fundamentals into brain structure. The intuition for me is built via my curiousity to explore and analyze the collective behavior of individual components in neural network when grouped, throughout first 2 years of my PhD, on paper with my pen.
Here, I attempted to keep every piece original and every piece is made by my understanding of the field fundamentals. I hope you enjoy reading my tutorial and fascinate by the predictive coding.
