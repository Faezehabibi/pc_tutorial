<details><summary> <h3>Retina</h3> </summary>

Retina preprocess the input information before sending to the brain's visual processing system. 
When the light beam hits an object and reflects, if it finds its way to our Retina, the retina acts 
like a receive which absorb the information and process it. This early stage processing happens prior 
to the moment that our brain perception starts. In order to reduce the processing computation in the 
visual cortex the Retina reduces the redundancy and only sends the informative signals (the information worth mentioning).

<!-- --------- input --------- -->
<details><summary> <strong>What goes into the Retina? </strong></summary>
The Retina's input is the light with different intensities.
The process starts when the light hits the Retina ($t=t_0$). 
</details>
<!-- --------- f --------- -->
<details><summary> <strong>What happens in the Retina?</strong>  </summary>
Retina's converts the light received to electrical signal.
In the Retina the input stimuli is processed further through multiple 
stages before sending to the higher levels. 
</details>
<!-- --------- output --------- -->
<details><summary> <strong>What goes out from the Retina?</strong> </summary>
The Retina's output is the electrical signal encoding the information in the intput light intensities.
The last processing stage in Retina is called Retina Ganglion Cell (RGC) 
which passes the Retina's final processed information upward
to its next processor Lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN).
