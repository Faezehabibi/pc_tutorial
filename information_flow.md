  <h3>Spatial dimension</h3>
  
  The information flow and its pathway, is determined by their starting point 
  (either **bottom** or **top**) and the direction they follows (either **up** or **down**):
  * **Top-down**: When the information source is at the **top** and it goes **downward**.
  * **Bottom-up**: When the information source is at the **bottom** and it goes **upward**. 

  <h3>Temporal dimension</h3>

  The information flow creates a stream (direction) where the information
  flows in time. Depending on the source of information, forward and backward 
  can be either top-down or bottom-up information pathway Considering the sequence of the
  information flow:
  * **Forward**: When the information goes forward in time; it is at the source and  
  goes away from the source. (moving with the flow)
  * **Backward**: When the information flows backward in time; it is at the descination
    and it backs down toward the source. in the opposite direction of forward. (moving against the flow)

  In order to specify the brain processing in the unified way, the brain processing 
  is considered to be vertically; dividing the brain system into 
  the hierarchy to specify the source and direction of the information.
  In the visual hierarchy we consider the Retina (eye) as the most bottom level
  and as it goes up into the brain processing, the information goes higher level.

  * If Retina be considered as the source of information where the stimuli 
  happens, once we observe (earliest), the information goes forward in time,
  upward to the higher levels in the brain for (later) processing, then the 
  information path is bottom-up and forward; while the information from the brain
  to the Retina is backward and top-down. 


  * **In Predictive Coding**: Brain is considered as the source of information where the prediction of
    the stimuli is sourced (earliest), and the information goes forward in time,
    downward to the lower-level in the brain for (later) assessment, then the
    information path is top-down and forward; while the information from Retina to
    the higher level of the brain is backward and bottom-up. (Information is sourced at the brain in time $t=t_0$)

  The observation happens when the reflected light from outside hits 
  the Retina and passes through it.
  
  Traditionally it has been thought that has unidirectional information flow encoding stimuli; 
  The stimuli (the input light) is sent forward to the brain to be processed and make the learning 
  happen; solely a bottom-up processing where there is a one-way flow 
  (forward only).
  
  **Forward pathway:** Retina (RGC) â†’ LGN â†’ V1 â†’ V2 â†’ ... â†’ V4 â†’ IT
