  <h3>Spatial dimension</h3>
  
  The information flow and its pathway, is determined by their starting point 
  (either **bottom** or **top**) and the direction they follows (either **up** or **down**):
  * **Top-down**: When the information source is at the **top** and it goes **downward**.
  * **Bottom-up**: When the information source is at the **bottom** and it goes **upward**. 

  <h3>Temporal dimension</h3>

  The information flow creates a stream (direction) where the information
  flows in time. Depending on the source of information, forward and backward can be
  either top-down or bottom-up information pathway. Considering the sequence of the
  information flow:
  * **Forward**: When the information goes forward in time; it is at the source and  
  goes away from the source.
  * **Backward**:
  
  , while backward means when information 
  flows in the opposite direction and it backs down (toward the 
  source). In other words, moving with the flow is called forward pathway 
  and moving against the flow is called backward pathway.
  

* **Forward = Top-down** and **Backward = Bottom-up**
   When the information source is at the **top**, so 
   it starts from the **top** and goes towards **down** (downward).
   Information moves with the flow (away from the source/
   up-stream/initial/begining of the stream).

* **Backward = Top-down** and **Forward = Bottom-up**
   When the information source is at the **bottom**, so 
   it starts from the **top** and goes towards **up** (upward). 
   Information moves against the flow (towards the source).
   Information moves up (towards the the source/
   down-stream/initial/end of the stream).

  In order to specify the brain processing in the unified way, we look 
  at the brain processing in a vertical way; dividing the brain system into 
  the hierarchy to specify the source and direction of the information.
  In the visual hierarchy we consider the Retina (eye) as the most bottom level and as we go 
  deeper up into the brain processing level the information goes higher.
  Also we consider the Retina as the source of information where the stimuli 
  happens at the bottom level once we observe (earliest).
  And the information is sent upward, towards the higher levels in the brain
  for later processing.
  Therefore the information flow is bottom-up and forward
  (starts at $t=t_0$ and reaches to the most top level at $t=T$).

  The observation happens when the reflected light from outside hits 
  the Retina and passes through it.
  
  Traditionally it has been thought that has unidirectional information flow encoding stimuli; 
  The stimuli (the input light) is sent forward to the brain to be processed and make the learning 
  happen; solely a bottom-up processing where there is a one-way flow 
  (forward only).
