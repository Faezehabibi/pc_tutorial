<h1> Neural Activation and Receptive Field </h1>

  A neuron can be either active (excited) or inactive (inhibited) in response to a stimulus.

  **Active Neuron**: When a neuron positively responses to a stimulus and its activity is increased as a respond
  to an input stimulus, it shows excitatory response and we say “the stimulus excites neuron”.
  
  **Inactive Neuron**: When a neuron activity is decreased (suppressed/inhibited) as a respond to an input stimulus, 
  it shows inhibitory response and we say “the stimulus inhibits neuron”.


In brain, different neurons are specialized to respond to specific sensory patterns. Receptive field is 
the property of a neuron that is used to represent a sensory pattern or stimulation that is expected 
to stimulate the neuron (increase or decrease the neuron's respond), directly or indirectly. [^longnote]. 

  
  [^longnote]: In the hierarchy, the receptive field of neurons spans to extended field as a 
  higher-level neuron responds to a collection of neural responses at the level 
  below which collectively forms the receptive field of that neuron characterizing
  the stimuli pattern which is most likely to make the neuron fire [2]. 


In order for brain to process complex patterns, neurons have different types of receptive fields.



  <h3>Classical Receptive Field (CRF)</h3>
  The primary area within the neuron's receptive field where stimulation can 
  directly effects the neuron's response; can either excite or inhibit the neuron.
   * Center-surround:


  <h3>Extra-Classical Receptive Field (ECRF)</h3>
   Extra-classical receptive field of a neuron (or non-classical receptive field)
   is the complementary area within the neuron's receptive field that is not intersecting
   with its classical receptive field. In other words, the part of a neuron's receptive field 
   which cannot directly (by itself) effect the neuron to response, but rather it indirectly can
   influence it is called the extra-classical receptive field of the neuron.

<details><summary> <h2>Extra Classical Receptive Fields Effects [3]</h2> </summary>

Existance of stimuli in the extra-classical receptive fields of a neuron cannot by itself
make a directly impact on the neuron's activation; but instead can effect on the neuron's
response indirectly through modulating the neuron's respond to the same stimuli in its classical 
receptive field. The prior assumption is that the same stimuli in ECRF also repeats in the CRF 
because in natural image (what our brain is trained on) scenes have conceptual correlation meaning
that usually the same pattern is continuous in small areas (patches) in an observation.

This prediction of neurons response made based on the prior assumption (generalizatin of the stimuli to CRF) 
can have several effects on the neuron's activity.




Surround Suppression: The case when the same conceptual/contextual stimuli as the extra-classical 
receptive field spans through the classical receptive field as well, the neuron's responsece can 
be predicted accurately by generalizing the extra-classical receptive field stimuli.

In case that the stimuli in the classical receptive field contexually differs from ones in
extra-classical receptive field, the neuron's responsece cannot be predicted correctly and 
the concepualizing assumption goes wrong.

In different scenarios either ECRF can modulate the neuron's response to its CRF or not.
If the input stimulus within the CRF deviates from what the stimulus context in ECRF predicts; 
the neuron responds vigorously. Depending on the type of deviation, the extra-classical receptive field
effect can be grouped as below:

  > "A vigorous response to an stimuli within the neuron's classical receptive field 
   that was most likely to activate the neuron is reduced or eliminated when the same 
   stimulus extends beyond the neuron’s classical receptive field (RF)" [1].
    
   > "When the stimulus properties in a neuron’s receptive field
   match the stimulus properties in the surrounding region, little
   response is evoked from the error-detecting neurons because the
  ‘surround’ can predict the ‘center.’ On the other hand, when the
   stimulus occurs in isolation, such a prediction fails, eliciting a
   relatively large response" [1,3].

  Length Tuned
  The neuron's response is suppressed when an optimally oriented bar extends
  beyond neuron's classical receptive fields; which arise due to the orientation-dependant
  correlation in the nature. 
  This indicates that neuron responds (activates) when the classical receptive fields
  carries information and do not responds the information is already been sent to the brain system.
  This indicates the brain is using efficient coding (redundancy reduction).
